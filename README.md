## Install

KaKi Manager: Currently not on TestFlight. Email us for a beta invite!

## Building from source
The server(less) is already running so all you need to do is replace any secrets `ðŸ¤«` in `app/` and `KaKi-manager/` with the respective IDs, keys, and secrets. Most notably:
* Firebase authentication info in `app/`
* Square application ID for OAuth in `KaKi-manager/`
